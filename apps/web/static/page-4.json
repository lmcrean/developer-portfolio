Chore: Removed outdated stack_decisions.md in root\r\n8. validated E2E backend with cd backend; npm run test:dev and npm run test:prod (development and production API endpoints for all apps confirmed as working)\r\n\r\n## auth app\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## assessment app\r\n\r\n1. added delete button functionality\r\n2. update assessment was not working, now fully removed (not included in Min Viable Product criteria)\r\n3. flattened assessment data structure for better readability and cleaner code;
