      "description": "\nThis PR refactors the entire API layer from monolithic files into a modular structure with one endpoint per file, following REST naming conventions.\n\n## Changes\n1. **Directory Structure Reorganization**\n   - Moved code from large files (auth.ts, assessment.ts) into proper subdirectories\n   - Created a core/ directory for shared utilities like apiClient\n\n2. **One File Per Endpoint**\n   - Split each API function into its own file following the naming convention: `{httpMethod}{Endpoint}.ts`\n   - Examples: `getList.ts`, `postLogin.ts`, `putUpdate.ts`, `deleteAssessment.ts`\n\n3. **Clear Type Organization**\n   - Separated types and schemas into dedicated files (`types.ts`, `schemas.ts`)\n   - Improved imports between modules\n\n4. **Consistent Error Handling**\n   - Standardized error handling patterns across all API calls\n\n## Benefits\n- **Improved Maintainability**: Single responsibility files make it easier to understand and modify endpoints\n- **Better Organization**: Naming convention clearly communicates HTTP methods used\n- **Code Reuse**: Shared utilities properly isolated in core/ directory\n- **Type Safety**: Proper type exports throughout the codebase\n- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained old API objects for gradual migration\n\n## Migration Notes\nThe refactoring maintains backward compatibility, so existing code using the API modules will continue to work. For new code, we recommend using the individual exports for better tree-shaking:\n\n```typescript\n// Before \nimport { authApi } from '../api';\nauthApi.login(credentials);\n\n// After (recommended)\nimport { login } from '../api';\nlogin(credentials);\n```\n\n## Testing\nAll tests have been confirmed to pass, and the build process completes successfully with no errors.\n",

The changes improve test reliability and better simulate real-world usage patterns.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd backend; npm run test:auth:dev:success\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis should return 100% pass",
