# Fine Art Painting

My Fine Art Painting practise lasted from early childhood until around 2018. Then from 2019-22 my attention naturally evolved into more of an interest in collaborating with young people, which lead to the science of learning.

I've had a few spells since such as a spontaneous self portrait below (while supervising another teacher in a very lively mask painting class!). 

These days I doubt I'll ever return to it -- which isn't as sad as it sounds. At the time of writing I enjoy artistic interests through many other mediums such as dance.

Looking back, it was a creative and soul-searching period of my life and I am proud of the work that emerged from it. I'm also grateful I fulfilled my biggest childhood dream of attending Art School, it was a wonderful experience.
