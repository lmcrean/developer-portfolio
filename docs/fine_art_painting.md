# Fine Art Painting

My Fine Art Painting practise lasted from early childhood until around 2018. Then from 2019-22 my attention naturally evolved into more of an interest in collaborating with young people, which lead to the science of learning.

I've had a few spells since such as a spontaneous self portrait below (while supervising another teacher in a very lively mask painting class!). 

At the time of writing I enjoy artistic interests through many other mediums such as dance. Artistically and professionally, I seem more and more engaged in the process of collaboration... In contrast these Paintings took place in what seems to have been more of a soul-searching period of my life. 

I am proud of the work that emerged from it; I'm equally grateful I fulfilled my biggest childhood dream of attending Art School, which was a wonderful experience.
