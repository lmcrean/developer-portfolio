# Methodology

The layers of the board are as follows:

- **Epic (Top level)** 
  - A collection of Sprints towards a specific value
  - Sprints must be relevant to the Epic
  - Sprints are ordered vertically on the epic board by urgency,  considering the value and viability scores, with most urgent at the top,
  - Sprints are organised into 3 columns as "Not Started", "In Progress", "Done"


- **Sprint** 
  - A collection of User Stories towards a specific goal
  - Must be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant
  - <div style="color:lightgreen">is assigned a value score out of 10 (green), 10 being the highest value</div>
  - <div style="color:lightblue">is assigned a viability score out of 10 (blue), 10 being the highest viability and 0 having the most blockers</div>
  - is labelled as "Not Started", "In Progress", "Done"
