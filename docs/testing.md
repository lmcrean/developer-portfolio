# Testing Strategy ✅ COMPLETED

## Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Unit Tests**: Jest with React Testing Library (apps/web/)
- **Integration Tests**: Vitest for component integration (integration/)
- **End-to-End Tests**: Playwright for full system testing (e2e/)
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing in GitHub Actions

## Unit Tests (apps/web/)

### React Component Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- ✅ Pull request feed component testing
- ✅ Component rendering and user interactions
- ✅ API service integration testing
- ✅ Error handling and loading states
- ✅ Responsive design validation

### API Unit Tests (apps/api/github/)
- ✅ GitHub API integration testing
- ✅ Caching mechanism validation
- ✅ Health endpoint testing
- ✅ Error handling and status codes

## Integration Tests (integration/)

### Cross-Component Integration (Vitest)
- ✅ Pull request feed with API service integration
- ✅ Component state management validation
- ✅ API response handling and error states
- ✅ Cross-browser compatibility testing

## End-to-End Tests (e2e/) ✅ COMPLETED

### Playwright Test Suite

**Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive end-to-end testing covering both API endpoints and full web application workflows.

### Test Configurations
- `playwright.config.ts` - Main configuration for local and production testing
- Environment-aware URL configuration for different deployment targets
- Support for both local development and production environments

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Pull request feed functionality
- ✅ API health endpoint validation (`/api/health`)
- ✅ GitHub API integration testing
- ✅ Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- ✅ Mobile device compatibility
- ✅ Performance and timeout handling
- ✅ Error handling and retry mechanisms
- ✅ CORS configuration testing
- ✅ Frontend-API integration validation

### Environment Variables for Production E2E Tests
- `WEB_DEPLOYMENT_URL` - Portfolio website URL
- `API_DEPLOYMENT_URL` - GitHub API service URL

### Key Features Tested
- Pull request feed component rendering
- GitHub API data fetching and caching
- Responsive design across different screen sizes
- Error states when API is unavailable
- Loading states during data fetching

## Testing Commands

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Web application unit tests
cd apps/web && npm test

# API unit tests (if implemented)
cd apps/api/github && npm test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run all integration tests
cd integration && npm test

# Run with UI
cd integration && npm run test:ui

# Run with coverage
cd integration && npm run test:coverage
```

### End-to-End Tests
```bash
# Run all E2E tests
cd e2e && npm test

# Run with browser UI
cd e2e && npm run test:headed

# Test specific components
cd e2e && npm run test:api:health      # API health checks
cd e2e && npm run test:web:pr-feed     # Pull request feed

# Start services for E2E testing
cd e2e && npm run dev:e2e              # Starts both web and API
```

### Testing Workflow
1. **Local Development**: Run unit tests during development
2. **Integration Testing**: Test component interactions before commits
3. **E2E Testing**: Validate full user workflows before deployment
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing on pull requests and deployments
